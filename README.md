# Overview of the Project
  This repository contains a series of machine learning projects showcasing different stages of the machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing and exploratory 
  analysis to model building, clustering, and hyperparameter tuning. 
  Below is a brief overview of each task:
  
# Task 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Objective: Clean and explore raw datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
# Task 2: Build and Train a Simple Machine Learning Model
  Objective: Build a supervised learning model to predict outcomes based on labeled datasets.
# Task 3: Mini Deep Learning Project
  Objective: Implement a simple deep learning model (e.g., CNN for image classification).
# Task 4: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
  Objective: Group data points into meaningful clusters and visualize high-dimensional data in reduced spaces.
# Task 5: Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
  Objective: Optimize the performance of machine learning models by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
